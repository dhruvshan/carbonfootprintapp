This is my NTU EEE 2022 FYP - Personal Carbon Footprint Application

## Application Stack

This project is built using Flutter and Dart on the Frontend with Firebase for the backend.

I also use several API's in this project:

- [Climatiq API: Calculates footprint values](https://www.climatiq.io/)
- [NewsAPI: Useful News system](https://newsapi.org/)
